### `payment_received`

Emitted by `receive_payment()` for every inbound payment regardless of `to_pool` mode.

| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `caller` — the vault or admin address that sent the payment                 |
| `from_vault` | data | Address | same as topic 1 (vault/admin caller)                                   |

**Example — `to_pool = true` (global pool credit):**

```json
{
  "topics": ["payment_received", "GCALLER..."],
  "data": {
    "from_vault": "GCALLER...",
    "amount": 5000000,
    "to_pool": true,
    "developer": null
  }
}
```

**Example — `to_pool = false` (developer credit):**

```json
{
  "topics": ["payment_received", "GCALLER..."],
  "data": {
    "from_vault": "GCALLER...",
    "amount": 2500000,
    "to_pool": false,
    "developer": "GDEV..."
  }
}
```

### `balance_credited`

Emitted by `receive_payment()` **only** when `to_pool = false`. Follows the `payment_received` event for the same call.

| Field         | Location | Type    | Description                                          |
|---------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0       | topics   | Symbol  | `"balance_credited"`                                 |
| topic 1       | topics   | Address | `developer` — the address whose balance was updated  |
| `developer`   | data     | Address | same as topic 1                                      |
| `amount`      | data     | i128    | amount credited in this call (USDC micro-units)      |
| `new_balance` | data     | i128    | developer's cumulative balance after this credit     |

**Example:**

```json
{
  "topics": ["balance_credited", "GDEV..."],
  "data": {
    "developer": "GDEV...",
    "amount": 2500000,
    "new_balance": 7500000
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `balance_credited` is never emitted when `to_pool = true`. Indexers tracking developer earnings should subscribe to this event; indexers tracking total protocol revenue should subscribe to `payment_received` with `to_pool = true`.
